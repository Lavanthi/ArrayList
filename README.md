COURSE TITLE: [AP CSA]

SECTION: [8:00-9:00]

DESCRIPTION: [This is a powerball game, where first the user types a bunch of numbers
 then the computer gives the mean,mode,median,and standard deviation.
 Then based on their dataset. then I see if it match with any of the other results.]

HONOR STATEMENT: [Lavanthi Narasimman] digitally signed

HOWTO: [tets code in intellJ, make a new repository in Github.paste code in github, download zip and submit it]

BIBLIOGRAPHY: [
used the cs slideshows
to understand break function: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_break.asp
binary search: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/
selection sort: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort-algorithm-2/]

RESOURCES: N/A

TUTORS: These are the tutors that helped me:
Brinda- She helped with turning it, cause I was confused at first, then she told me to download the project and end it, she also helped me
 with the binarySearch, the code was not working properly, then we realized that in the if statements, i put .size instead of get(i), so I got the szie instead of the index
Roberto/Evan- he helped me with two things. At one point, what happened is that my code would not run,
 like it ran the first problem but not the 2nd, Roberto and Evan looked at my code
they then noticed that I forgot to download import the powerballNumbers.txt file. Evan also told me to use
the break method in my code. He also helped me with the part , on me making LotteryNumber code in the main class
the one where I make a set of 5 numbers and compare it to the powerballNumbers.


COMMENTS: I do remember that I can and met with you because I didn't understand the 2nd task to do but other than that i have no other comment

REFLECTION: [This took 3-4 hours to do. I would say the first problem probably took like 0 minites, the 2nd problem however took much longer.
It took me a while to even understand what I was even supposed ot do, for that I met with you and also asked Brinda for some help.
 Both you and her explain what to do. Then when I wrote my while loop in the main class, i didn't know how to end it or come out of it,
 I tried to write this long complex if statement in the while statement, but then Evan told me just to use the break method and even showed me a website, that I used.
  Another issues was with the LotteryNumbers, at one points I would constantly run my code and the first task worked but the program threw an error
  anytime the 2nd task was about to start, I remember, I rewrote my code and even wrote my entire LotteryNumbers class from the starts
  I showed the error to Roberto and Evan and turn out I had forgotten to add the PowerBallNumbers, silly mistake.]
